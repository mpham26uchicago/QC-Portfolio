# Day 4
Here you can find the material corresponding to day 4 of TEQS. Lecture notes contain quantum oracles and Deutsch's algorithm.

Unlike the past two problem sets, problem set 4 only contains a theory section. However, this section is longer than that from previous problem sets, and probably also a bit harder. Don't be afraid by this, just read the information given in the problem set carefully, that is basically all you need to know! If you are stuck, feel free to make any questions about the problems in `#q-n-a` or reach out to mentors!

The digital notebook filled during the lecture is also given.
